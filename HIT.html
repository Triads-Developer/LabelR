      <full-instructions><h2>Instructions</h2><p>
This task involves reading the text of two television advertisements aired during the 2008 U.S. Senate elections. 
Researchers will use your responses to better understand the "tone" of each political ad.
<br></br>
<b>Your job is to read the text of both ads and select the ad that is either most negative (or least positive) towards the candidate(s) mentioned.</b>
<br></br>
<b>Your performance will be monitored as you complete these HITs. 
We will reject all work done by workers who provide poor quality answers.</b>
<br></br>
Do not allow your own political opinions to influence your decisions. 
Your goal is to select the ad that other workers would recognize as the most negative (or least positive).
</p> <h2>Here are a few rules of thumb to guide you</h2><ul><li>If both advertisements attack a candidate, pick whichever of the two advertisements is most negative</li><li>If both advertisements praise a candidate, pick whichever of the two advertisements is least positive</li><li>Ads that attack a candidate's personal characteristics are generally more negative than ads that  attack a candidate's record or job performance<ul><li>"Bob is dishonest" is more negative than "Bob is too liberal"</li></ul></li><li>Ads that attack an individual are generally more negative than ads that attack a group<ul><li>"Bob is a Washington fat cat" is more negative than "We need to stop the fat cats in Washington"</li></ul></li><li>Ads that attack a specific candidate alone are generally more negative than ads that contrast two candidates<ul><li>"Bob is unqualified" is more negative than "Bob is unqualified, but Jill is very experienced"</li></ul></li><li>Ads that state a policy position are generally less positive than ads that praise a candidate as a person<ul><li>"Bob will fix unemployment" is less positive than "Bob is a leader"</li></ul></li></ul><p>
Please continue to fully read each ad text and provide your best guess of the correct answer. 
<b>Your performance will be monitored as you complete more HITs. 
If you provide poor quality answers, all of your work will be rejected and your Compare Senate Ads qualification will be revoked.</b>
