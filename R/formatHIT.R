#' Format a MTurk HIT
#'
#' \code{formatHIT} formats the HTML code required to make a MTurk HIT.
#'
#' @param question_prompt A string containing the common question prompt used
#' across all pairwise comparison questions.
#' @param instruction_overview A string providing general instructions for the HITs
#' @param instruction_list A nested list of strings containing bulleted instructions
#' and examples. Each element of the list object corresponds to a separate bullet
#' in the list of instructions. Nesting list objects within one another will allow
#' for nested bullets.
#' @param short_instruction_list A nested list of lists containing bulleted instructions
#' for HITs. This should be an abridged version of \code{instruction_list} that is
#' displayed within the HIT's short instruction tab.
#' @param closing_message A string containing the final text presented in the
#' training module. This should contain warnings about worker monitoring and/or
#' rate limiting procedures.
#' @param doc_labels A vector of strings indicating the labels to be assigned to
#' each document.
#' @param file_name A string containing the desired name of the output HTML file.
#' @details
#' The function writes a generic .html file required to make a MTurk HIT. Though
#' the function is designed for users to pass strings directly into
#' the arguments, the arguments also accept HTML-formatted text.
#'
#' @return A string of HTML code that formats a HIT for MTurk. This is also
#' written as a .html file in the working directory for users to make manual
#' revisions.
